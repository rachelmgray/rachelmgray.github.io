Hello! My name is Rachel Gray. I'm a researcher in gravitational-wave cosmology. I completed my MSci in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Glasgow in 2017, and went on to do a PhD with the Institute for Gravitational Research there. I gained my PhD in 2021, and started a Postdoc at Queen Mary University of London. In 2023 I became a lecturer at the University of Glasgow, where my time is split between research and teaching.
